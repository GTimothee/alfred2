# Organization

Morning grinds
1. Daily SRS Review (15 min): This is the most important change. Start your morning session with your Anki review. It’s a perfect warm-up. It primes your brain with the concepts you've been learning and, most importantly, it guarantees your most crucial retention habit gets done first.
2. Project Work (Remaining Time): After the review, dive into your project work as usual.

Evenings
1. start by reviewing summaries
2. then learn new things

Wednesdays midday
- job search
    1. Find 2-3 specific job openings that are a strong match for your skills and interests.
    2. Write a tailored cover letter and resume for each one. Do not mass-apply. Quality over quantity is key.
- for japan
    You need to prepare two specific documents in Japanese if possible, or at least in a highly formal English format that mimics them:
    Rirekisho (履歴書): This is a standardized resume format. It includes personal information, education, and work history. A professional headshot is mandatory.
    Shokumu Keirekisho (職務経歴書): This is your professional work history, but it's more detailed than a Western CV. For each job, you describe the company, your role, responsibilities, and, most importantly, your specific accomplishments and contributions to the team.
    Top Targets: Large tech companies with an international workforce like Rakuten, Mercari, LINE, Indeed Japan, and Woven by Toyota.
    Use a Japan-Specific Job Board: Generic job boards are less effective. Use sites like Japan Dev, GaijinPot Jobs, and LinkedIn (with your location set to Tokyo).
    Language is Key: If you don't have any Japanese ability, start learning now and put "Beginner Japanese (Studying for JLPT N5)" on your resume. This shows long-term commitment. If you have a certification (JLPT), feature it prominently.
    Write a Cover Letter: Briefly explain your strong interest in not just the job, but in living and working in Japan long-term. This helps de-risk you as a candidate.
- south korea: 
    Targeting is Crucial: Focus on the big tech players in areas like Pangyo Techno Valley (often called the Silicon Valley of Korea). Companies like Samsung, Naver, Kakao, and Coupang have global talent acquisition programs. Also, look at well-funded startups that need international talent.
    CV is More Western, But Still Conservative: The resume is closer to a Western style than Japan's, but a professional photo is still standard practice. Keep the formatting clean and professional.
    Highlight Elite Credentials: The Korean market places a very high value on educational prestige and quantifiable achievements. Emphasize the ranking of your university and use hard numbers to showcase your accomplishments.
    Language (TOPIK): Similar to Japan, showing a commitment to learning Korean (and having a TOPIK score) is a significant advantage.
- montreal 
    Simply applying for jobs is ineffective. Your #1 priority should be to see if you qualify for Canada's Express Entry program. This is a points-based system that ranks you based on age, education, work experience, and language skills. A high score gets you an invitation to apply for permanent residency, making you infinitely more attractive to employers.
    North American Resume Style: Your CV should be a standard North American resume. This means no photo, no age, no marital status. It should be tailored with keywords from the job description to pass through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
    Target Companies that Sponsor: Use LinkedIn and other job boards with filters like "visa sponsorship." Focus on companies that have a history of hiring international talent. Many companies cannot or will not go through the complex LMIA (Labour Market Impact Assessment) process required to hire a foreign worker.
