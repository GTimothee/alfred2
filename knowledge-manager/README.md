🗺️ Project Roadmap
Of course. Here is a more granular, action-oriented roadmap that follows the "build, test, integrate" flow you described.

## Phase 1: Building and Integrating the Core Processing Engine

    [ ] Build the Standalone Engine: Write the core processing logic as a local Python script. This script should take a URL (for a web page or YouTube video) as an argument, perform all the scraping/transcription, call the Gemini API for a summary, and print the result. Test this thoroughly on your local machine.

      think - Apple quality - .

      - review the code
      - make a design graph of the system
      - refine the way the data is stored and versioned properly
      - write tests as much as possible

    [ ] Package the Engine for the Cloud: Port the local script into a Databricks Notebook. Test the notebook by running it manually inside the Databricks environment with a hardcoded URL to ensure all dependencies work correctly in the cloud.

    [ ] Build and Test the Queue System: Create the SQS queue. Write a separate, simple "listener" script in Databricks that does nothing but check the queue and log any new messages it finds. Manually send a test message (e.g., a simple URL) to the SQS queue to confirm the listener script works.

    [ ] Integrate the Engine with the Queue: Modify the main Databricks processing notebook. Instead of using a hardcoded URL, it should now be triggered by the listener and retrieve the URL from the SQS message. Trigger a full test by sending a URL to SQS and verifying that the correct summary is produced.

    [ ] Build and Test the Data Store: Create the RDS database and the processing_jobs table. In your Databricks notebook, add a final step to connect to the database and write a dummy record to the table to test the connection.

    [ ] Integrate the Engine with the Data Store: Finalize the main Databricks notebook. It should now update the processing_jobs table with the job's status ("processing", "completed", "failed") and the final summary.

## Phase 2: Building the Slack Bot Ingestion Interface

    [ ] Build a Basic "Echo Bot": Create a simple AWS Lambda function (triggered by API Gateway) that does nothing but receive a request from your Slack App and log the event payload to CloudWatch. This tests that the fundamental Slack -> API Gateway -> Lambda connection is working.

    [ ] Integrate the Bot with the Queue (for URLs): Extend the Lambda function. It should now parse the event from Slack, extract any URLs from the message text, and send them as a new message to your SQS queue. Test this by sending a link to your bot and checking if the message appears in SQS.

    [ ] Test the Full URL Workflow End-to-End: Send a URL to your Slack bot. Verify that the Lambda is triggered, the message appears in SQS, the Databricks job runs successfully, and the final results are correctly written to your RDS database.

    [ ] Extend the Bot for File Handling: Modify the Lambda function to handle the file_shared event. This new logic will use the file_id to download the file from Slack, upload it to your S3 bucket, and then send the file's S3 path to the SQS queue.

    [ ] Test the Full File Workflow End-to-End: Upload a PDF to your Slack bot and verify that the entire processing pipeline runs correctly.

## Phase 3: Building the Review & Management UI

    [ ] Build the Local Dashboard: Create a Reflex application on your local machine that connects directly to your AWS RDS database. The goal is to build the UI to display the contents of the processing_jobs table in a clean, readable format.

    [ ] Containerize the Dashboard: Write a Dockerfile that packages your working local Reflex application into a container image. Build the image locally to ensure it works.

    [ ] Deploy and Integrate the Dashboard: Push your container image to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry). Deploy the image using AWS App Runner, configuring the necessary environment variables (like database credentials) so it can connect to your RDS instance in the cloud.

## Phase 4: Building the Automated Content Crawler

    [ ] Build the Standalone Crawler Logic: Create a new Databricks Notebook. Write the code to read a list of sources from your tracked_sources table in RDS and use RSS feeds or APIs to find and print any new content. Run this manually to test the discovery logic.

    [ ] Integrate the Crawler with the Queue: Modify the crawler notebook so that instead of printing the new URLs, it sends them as messages to your SQS queue. Run it manually and verify that the main processing engine correctly picks up and processes these new jobs.

    [ ] Automate the Crawler: Configure a new scheduled Databricks Job to run your crawler notebook on a recurring basis (e.g., once per day).

## Phase 5: Future Enhancements

    [ ] Build and Integrate the RAG Chatbot.

    [ ] Build and Integrate a Browser Extension for Ingestion.

    [ ] Build the "Mega Book" Knowledge Synthesizer Job.
